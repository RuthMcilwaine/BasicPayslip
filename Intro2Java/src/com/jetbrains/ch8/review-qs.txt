Section 8.2-8.5
8.1 Describe the relationship between an object and its defining class. How do you define a class? How do you declare an object reference variable? How do you create an object?
How do you declare and create an object in one statement.
A class is a template that defines the properties and behaviours for objects. An object is an instance of a class. Objects are accessed via the
object's reference variables, which contain references to the objects.
Object reference variable is declared using ClassName variableName;
Create an object using ClassName variableName = new ClassName();

8.2 What are the differences between constructors and methods?
A constructor has three characteristics; it is invoked to create an object using the new operator, they play the role of initializing objects.
A constructor must have the same name as the class itself and it does not have a return type - not even void. A class has a default constructor if one is not defined.
A method is a function that is created within a class. Calling it executes the code inside the method. A method can be reused. A method has access to all of the objects properties.

8.3 Is an array an object or a primitive type value? Can an array contain elements of an object type as well as a primitive type? Describe the default value for the elements of an array.
An array is an object that is is created using new operator and has several methods. An array can contain elements of an object type as well as a primitive types. The default value for the
elements of an array is 0 for numeric, false for boolean, '\u0000' for char, null for object element type.
