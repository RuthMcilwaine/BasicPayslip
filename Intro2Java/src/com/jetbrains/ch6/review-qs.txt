# 6.1 How do you declare and create an array?
int[] array = new int[arraysize];

#6.2 How do you access elements of an array?
array[index];

#6.3 Is memory allocated for an array when it is declared? // no
When is the memory allocated for an array? // at initializing
What is the printout of the following code? //
int x =30
int[] numbers = new int[x]
x=60;
System.out.println("x is " + x);
System.out.println("The size of numbers is " + numbers.length);

#6.4 Indicate true of false for the following statements;
Every element in an array has the same type.  //T
The array size is fixed after it is declared.  //F
The array size is fixed after it is created. //T
The elements in an array must be of primitive data type. //F

#6.5 Which of the following statements are valid array declarations?
int i = new int(30); //not an array
double d[] = new double[30]; //true
char[] r = new char(1..30)  //not a char
int i[] = (3, 4, 3, 2);  //()?
float f[] = {2.3, 4.5, 6.6}; //true
char[] c = new char(); //need to have char inside brackets

#6.6 What is the array index type? //int
What is the lowest index? //[0]
What is the representation of the third element in an array named a? //[2]

#6.7 Write statements to do the following:
a. Create an array to hold 10 double values.
    double[] arr = new double[10];
b.Assign value 5.5 to the last element in the array.
    arr[9] = 5.5;
    arr[arr.length-1] = 5.5;
c. Display the sum of the first two elements.
    arr[0] + arr[1];
d. Write a loop that computes the sum of all elements in the array.
    int total = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
       total += arr[i];
    }
e.Write a loop that finds the minimum element in the array.
     int total = 0;
     for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if(arr[i] < min)
        min = arr[i]
     }
f.Randomly generate an index and display the element of this index in the array.

    int index = (int) (Math.random() * arr.length);
    int element = array[index];


g.Use an array initializer to create another array with initial values
    double[] arr = {3.5, 5.5, 4.52, 5.6};

#6.8 What happens when your program attempts to access an array element with an invalid index?

#6.9 Identify and fix the errors in the following code:

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    double[] r = double[100];
    for(int i = 0; i < r.length; i++){
        r[i] = (Math.random() * 100);
    }
    }
}
