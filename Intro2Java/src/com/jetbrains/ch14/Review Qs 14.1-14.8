#14.1 Which of the following classes definitions defines a legal abstract class?
e) abstract class A {
    abstract void unfinished();
    }

f) abstract class A {
    abstract int unfinished();
    }

#14.2 The getArea() and getPerimeter() methods may be removed from the GeometricObject class. What are the benefits of defining getArea() and getPerimeter() as abstract methods in the GeometricObject class?
So that all subclasses can also access the getArea() and getPerimeter().

#14.3 An abstract class can be used just like a nonabstract class except that you cannot use the new operator to create an instance from the abstract class. True

#14.4 Which of the following is a correct interface?
d) interface A {
    void print();
    }

#14.5 If a class implements Comparable, the object of the class can invoke the compareTo method. True

#14.6 Two max methods are defined in 14.5. Explain why the max with the signature max(Comparable, Comparable) is better than the one with the signature max(Object, Object).
comparable1 is declared as a comparable in the first example, so no casting is needed.

#14.7 You can define the compareTo method in a class without implementing the Comparable interface. What are the benefits of implementing the Comparable interface?
The benefit of implementing the interface is that some methods specifically require object that implements the Comparable interface. It gives them a guarantee that
the object you're passing has a compareTo method with the correct signature.

#14.8 If a class implements java.awt.event.ActionListener, the object of the class can invoke the actionPerformed method. True
